        <p class="homepage-description">S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl (Ukrainian: S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Серце
            Чорнобиля) is a 2024 first-person shooter, survival horror video game developed and published by GSC Game
            World. It is the fourth main game released in the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. video game series, as well as the first
            S.T.A.L.K.E.R. game in 15 years since the release of Call of Pripyat in 2009.

            Initially announced following the release of Call of Pripyat, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 was planned to release in
            2012, before it was ultimately cancelled on the year of its intended release. The game resurfaced years
            later in 2018, with the development restarted and powered by Unreal Engine 5. It was scheduled to release
            for Windows and Xbox Series X/S on 8 December 2022, but due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, development
            for the game was put on hold.

            Following multiple delays, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl was released on 20 November 2024. One
            million copies were sold within two days of its release, with the game receiving mixed reviews. A
            PlayStation 5 version of the game is also scheduled to release in Q4 2025.</p>
