			New, limited, cool! Meet it! This is NON STOP S.T.A.L.K.E.R. GREEN! We continue our collaboration with the
			legendary game S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chernobyl and are constantly experimenting with flavors to please
			fans of NON STOP and the game series - and here is the result: a new flavor is here! This is another step in
			our joint journey - and definitely not the last. You won't find a new drink among the green Zone, but it can
			definitely become your companion in reality. Just remember that the quantity is limited. ? NON STOP
			S.T.A.L.K.E.R. GREEN is a combination of refreshing lime and mint with juicy blackberry. The novelty will
			help you keep up the pace at work, during study or a night raid on the Zone.

			Stalkers! As always, we've read your feedback on Steam and other social media, and have prepared patch
			1.2.1. It's mostly focused on fixing crashes, particularly when loading save files.
			A quick update that should make your journey through the Zone a little more comfortable, here's the list of
			changes:
			Fixed one of the crashes when loading save files related to AI logic.
			Fixed one of the crashes when loading save files that were recorded when effects were applied to the player
			(such as bleeding or drowsiness).
			Fixed several crashes related to the interaction of the ball lightning anomaly with artifacts.
			Fixed crashes that mostly occurred when moving away from hubs and during Ejection.
			<a href="#top" class="to-top-btn">↑ Back to Top</a>

		<p class="nav-article" id="fourth">
			Reduced the anti-radiation effect of the Strange Water artifact.
			Fixed a bug where a grenade would damage the Burer when his shield was active.
			NPCs now need fewer shots to kill a pseudo-dog phantom.
			Increased the attack rate in the jump for the Blind Dog.
			Balanced pistols and silencers.
			Reduced the spawn rate of NPCs in exoskeletons.
			Readjusted the armor worn by NPCs. Increased the chance of spawning low and medium-level armor, while the
			chance of spawning higher-level armor has been reduced.
			Increased radiation damage depending on accumulated radiation.
			Reduced the chance of NPCs with high-level weapons appearing in the early stages of the game.
			Rebalanced the weapon sets used by A-life NPCs.
			Added the ability to trade with additional NPCs in hubs.
			Fixed rewards for repeatable missions on Veteran difficulty.
			And a few other minor balance changes.

			The Zone holds many secrets and treasures, and of all of them, artifacts are the most studied and
			systematized. But they still remain mysterious and valuable, as their properties change and transform, just
			like the land that gives birth to them. Even before the advent of the NDICHAZ, scientists behind the
			Perimeter generously rewarded the desperate who found the rarest specimens. Years have passed, and stalkers
			still risk their lives for the sake of artifacts.

			Frame rates on the GeForce RTX 4070 jump from 30 FPS to 70 FPS, significantly increasing the smoothness,
			clarity of the game and smooth animation, and as you move up the GPU stack, the numbers only increase.

			Having a weapon in the Zone is not enough. After a few fights, it needs to be repaired. If you want to adapt
			it for more specific scenarios or, conversely, make it more versatile, upgrade it in the technician and
			install improvements on the fly. But even that may not be enough... What “tool” should you take on a sortie?
			What type of ammunition should you choose? What improvements will help you the most? These are just some of
			the questions you should consider before heading into the Zone. Just remember: preparation is the key to
			survival.

			To all interested stalkers, The physical edition of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl has always been a
			subject of interest for stalkers. As your trip to the Zone draws closer and closer, we would like to clarify
			the status of the delivery of the physical editions, or how you can still order them if you haven't done so
			already. In short, the initial number of physical editions is already mostly sold out, but we would like to
			satisfy the existing demand. Therefore, we will make another print run.
